Great — the **content is solid**, it just needs **Markdown cleanup + small polishing** so it looks professional on GitHub and doesn’t confuse evaluators.

Below is a **cleaned, corrected, GitHub-ready README.md**.
You can **replace your README entirely with this** (copy–paste).

# CuraLens 🩺  
### AI-Assisted Oral Cancer Screening System

CuraLens is a deep learning–based web application designed to assist in the **screening of oral cancer** from oral cavity images.  
It is intended as an **AI decision-support tool**, not a replacement for medical professionals.

---

## 🔍 Project Motivation
Oral cancer has a high prevalence in countries like India, where early detection can significantly improve survival rates.  
This project explores how **computer vision and transfer learning** can assist in early screening using medical images.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Binary classification: **Cancer vs Non-Cancer**
- CNN with transfer learning (MobileNetV2)
- Command-line prediction tool
- Web application for interactive use
- Adjustable screening vs diagnostic thresholds
- Clear clinical disclaimers

---

## 🧠 Model Overview
- Architecture: MobileNetV2 + custom classifier
- Input size: 224 × 224 RGB
- Output: Cancer probability (0–1)
- Loss: Binary Cross-Entropy
- Training strategy:
  - Class weighting
  - Data augmentation
  - Early stopping
  - Learning rate scheduling
